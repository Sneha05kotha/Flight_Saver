# Flight_Saver
Application to provide Users to swap their flight tickets online

IMPLEMENTATIONS :

Asana Usage: Defined and used Asana according to criteria mentioned. 

Completeness: 
- prototype is running
- no bugs
- prototype is developed for mobile application on Proto.io and project is made as a website. 
- There is no real back end in our project as our project is dealing with the real time information of the flight available. So we cant use a real back end in the project as of now. 
- Extra feature: The application would use Blockchain technology, which would not require physical ID proofs and makes the ticket swapping fast by having a de-centralised blockchain and a real time chat box which lets user negotiate the price and user can chat with the ticket owner. Blockchain allows us to encrypt the chat. 


Code Quality:
- The code is clean and documented properly. 
- Most of the tricky parts of code are commented for better clarity. 
- Everyone in team were working on their separately, so we have followed a scheme in which everyone has to complete their part and test themselve. Once they are satisfied with the pages, they should push the project to master branch to make the integration easier. Commits are well explained. 
- Code follows the convention and is written in an optimised manner. 


User Experience: 
- In case of both mobile application prototype and web application, user can start the app easily and use it. Whole team followed particular directions to make the project more usuable and understandable for the user. 
- More Usable, More Understandable: the project is easy to use by any user. We have followed the Nielson heuristics while developing the usability aspect of the project. User will require the least number of taps which are sufficient while doing any task. 
- There are no lags, Code is optimised. 
- There are no such confusion, the app is developed taking a novice user into the consideration. 


BONUS: SCALABILITY, SECURITY & ANALYTICS:
  - The ideal users for the application are in millions, so we would require a huge server to work on. 
  - API credentials and Sensitive data will be stored in BLOCKCHAIN, we are gonna implement blockchain technology which creates a decentralised database with high quality encryption enables us to have more security. 
  - We have conducted a Survery to take the feedback from the user, and we will be doing regular surveys to change our UX improving the application usability. 
  


Note: The Website's front end UI is completed, We have not focused on styling as we wanted to show the functionality. 

Our idea requires us to get the data from Airline and Aiport Authorities, thus, we didn't work on backend development and used mocked data to show the execution of the idea.
